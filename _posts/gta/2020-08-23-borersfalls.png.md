It is a beautiful tail along the Escarpment to Borerâ€™s Falls. Borer's Falls is a 15 metre high curtain style waterfall that once powered the Rock Chapel Village Sawmill. Owned by the Borer family for over 100 years. On our way to the Falls, we were off the trail and climbed up the escarpment to the top. It was fun but defintely not recommended for family with small children.
