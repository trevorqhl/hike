We have been thinking about rebuilding my rotting deck for a while. Fortounately this year, with the help from my growning up children, we finally started the project.

April 26, the draining surrounding the deck has been a problem every spring, we decided to replacd the grass with a gravel pathway.

We use 5x9 inch mini beltis garden wall brick from Rona for the edge. My cat Edgy was inspecting the completed edge of the pathway.

May 11, we started taking out the rails mainly with a reciprocating saw.

May 18, the old deck boards were secured to the frame by nails. We tried different ways to take them out. The best way for us is to use a circular saw to cut the boards along the frame, and then place the reciprocating saw in between to cut the rails.

June 6, we rent a tiller from Home Depot to reomve the lawn for the pathway. It was probably not the best decision, the tiller also loosen the soil and we had to a manual tamper compact and level the soil.
