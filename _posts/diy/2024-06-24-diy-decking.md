We have been talking about rebuilding the rotting deck year after year. Fortounately in the spring of 2024, with the help from my growing up children, we finally started the project. The blueprint starts with removing the old deck boards, keeping the frame with a fresh coat of stain, constructing a gravel pathway around the deck, building two raised garden beds, a fire pit, a bench, and a base for the patio umbrella on the side, and finally installing the new composite deck boards with consideration of adding bench on the deck.

<b>April 26</b> The draining surrounding the deck has been a problem every spring, we decided to replacd the lawn with a gravel pathway.
We use 5x9 inch mini beltis garden wall bricks from Rona for the edge. My cat Edgy was inspecting the completed edge of the pathway.

<b>May 18</b> The old deck boards were secured to the frame by nails. We tried different ways to take them out. The best way turned out to be using a circular saw to cut the boards along the frame, and then placing the reciprocating saw in between to cut the nails.

<b>June 6</b> We rent a tiller from Home Depot to reomve the lawn for the pathway. It was probably not the best decision because the tiller could loosen the soil. The rental compactor is too heavy to carry home so we used a manual tamper to compact and level the soil.

<b>June 24</b> I started taking 2 weeks off from work to get more work done before the summer is over. We laid out the raised garden beds, a fire pit, and a bench on the right side of the deck.
