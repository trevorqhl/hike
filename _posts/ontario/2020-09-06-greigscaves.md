You will hike about 1.8km loop to explore the limestone caves for about 45 mintues, before you exit, you can take another 10 minutes to hike waterview loop for a beautiful view of Georgian Bay. It is a family run business by the Greig faimly. I spoke to the owner on our way out. He inherited this 200 acre land from his grandfather who purchased in 1926 for $3,400.
